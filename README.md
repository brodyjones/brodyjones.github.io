**Hi, welcome to my AOS C111/204 final project!** <img align="right" width="220" height="220" src="/assets/IMG/template_logo.png">

For this project, I applied a machine learning model using real-world data on large scale wave energy farms, then published the report on this website.

* I found this rich dataset by browsing the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets)

## Guide to Adding Content
* Your repository's `README.md` file (the file you are reading now) acts like a home page. Replace its contents with whatever you want the world to see by editing the file on GitHub.
* If you want to turn this page into a CV or blog, etc., it may be useful to refer to a [guide for writing Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
* You can create other markdown files (.md) in your repository and navigate to them from this page using links, i.e.: [here is a link to another file, `project.md`](project.md)
* When editing a markdown file on GitHub, it is useful to wrap text by selecting the *Soft wrap* option as shown: ![screenshot](/assets/IMG/instr_wrap.png)
* If you want to get even more technical, you can also write HTML in your .md files, and GitHub Pages will render it. For example, the image below is displayed by writing the following (edit this file to see!): `<img align="right" width="200" height="200" src="/assets/IMG/template_frog.png">`

## Deliverables

This final project is delivered in two components: a report and my code.

### Report

Your report should be **delivered via your website**. 
The link for my paper report is [here](/assets/wave_energy_farm_research.pdf). 

### Code

A link to my code was submitted on BruinLearn, but I have also linked the Google Colab file [here](/assets/final_project.ipynb)
