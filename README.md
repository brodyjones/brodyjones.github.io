**Hi, welcome to my AOS C111/204 final project!** <img align="right" width="220" height="220" src="/assets/IMG/template_logo.png">

For this project, I applied a machine learning model using real-world data on large scale wave energy farms, then published the report on this website.

* I found this rich dataset by browsing the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets)

## Deliverables

This final project is delivered in two components: a report and my code.

### Report

Your report should be **delivered via your website**. 
The link for my paper report is [here](/assets/wave_energy_farm_research.pdf). 

### Code

A link to my code was submitted on BruinLearn, but I have also linked the Google Colab file [here](/assets/final_project.ipynb)
